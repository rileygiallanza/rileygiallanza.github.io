      <description>&lt;p&gt;footnote example &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansive history of pre-industrial China had its social norms rooted in people’s appreciation for the world in which they lived. By this, the cultural competence that traditional art forms, such as landscape paintings, facilitated in China focused on the idea that man was not powerful enough to dominate the natural world and exploit its resources. Rather, nature and man established a society in which the natural world dominated humans. Only after the Industrial Revolution did the dynamism associated with production and profit lead to man over nature becoming the prevalent social contract. Unfortunately, the cultural standard for the natural world was not strong enough in the nineteenth century to oppose the endorsement of an industrialized, man-focused economy. The adopted framework of businesses in post-industrial China includes that anthropogenic activities, such as pollution, can be externalized on society for the purpose of maximizing economic progress, which has led to intense environmental damage. The current political and social movements in China are at a crossroads &amp;ndash; politics governed by economically-motivated lobbyists has allowed incidences, like in Huangpu River, to play out, while the social hubbub of public art is leading to individual and community empowerment models that are fighting for change within our systems to create a more environmentally friendly world. In this paper, the focus will shift from the social and political forces that are the reason for environmental degradation, to instead arguing that the adoption and modernization of art forms will empower society to fight for change for the sake of the environment and fix the issues that stemmed from the cultural adoption of humans being above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2013, over 16000 pig carcusses were pulled out of the Huangpu River in Shanghai in the span of two weeks. The destination of origin, Jiaxing, a large pig-farming province that’s upstream of the city, was responsible for providing 7.78 million pigs to the Chinese market in 2012 alone. Although the Shanghai Municipal Water Authority deemed the water to meet the standard for safe consumption, there were many environmental and health implications the residents located along the river had to deal with. The pigs tested positive for porcine circovirus (PVC), foot and mouth disease, swine fever, hog cholera, and blue-ear pig disease. Alone, these diseases are not known to be infectious to humans, but the means by which the pigs had these diseases is what was concerning. Because pork is the most widely consumed meat in China, the density of pig farmers is very high. In Jiaxing specifically, the pig farms were “small-scale enterprises”, but there was a large accumulation of them in the area (Ejatlas). These farms were also very poorly kept, therefore they were discharging pollutants in amounts exceeding the carrying capacity of the environment, which led to the facilitation of these swine-based pathogens and the ultimate death of numerous pigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a need to rid large amounts of carcasses, and weak regulations in place, instead of properly disposing of the dead pigs, many farmers began selling these pathogenic carcasses to slaughterhouses. This resulted in the meat being sold in markets for illegal profits. Once the health concerns began to make their way to public knowledge, the illegal trade of contaminated pork was cracked down on. This is when farmers began disposing of the carcasses in the water supply because it was more convenient. However, before the farmers were caught in their illegal trading scheme, they grew accustomed to using a feed additive in the pig’s diet that was a form of organic arsenic . The chemical components help make the pigs look more aesthetically healthy and viable to consumers from the markets. Arsenic, however, is identified as a human carcinogen, as noted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Therefore, when the contaminated pigs were sold in markets people would directly consume small levels of arsenic. When the pigs were dumped in the Huangpu River, the arsenic levels were small enough to not be detected by the municipality, so when it was deemed potable, consumers of the river would indirectly be ingesting arsenic. The clear environmental impacts were water pollution, livestock damage, and insecurity of drinking water quality, and the health impacts were unknown exposure to infectious diseases and carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political and social forces at play that interrupted China’s cultural appreciation of the environment led to this instance and others alike in their capacity for environmental degradation. First, climate change is largely anthropogenic. The consumption and production levels by humans are by far the largest contributor to the release of greenhouse gases. Human activities, like pollution and habitat fragmentation, can produce numerous stressors on aquatic ecosystems; chemical pollution by agricultural and livestock waste discharge can fundamentally change features of coastal ecosystems and the potability of clean drinking water. From this regard, the mechanisms by which the industrial revolution took precedence over the societal norm that the environment is its own sovereign body demonstrate how influential the argument for production was over the centuries worth of paintings, stories, and textiles that told the narrative of China’s appreciation for nature. Second, as the ideals of a production-driven economy settled into China’s landscape, they soared to rank number one in the world for the production of industrial goods like steel, cement, and modern technology. However, this adoption of the “polluter industrial complex” has led to the pollution of many natural resources; according to MEEPRC 2017, the groundwater quality for 60% of sites being monitored has been classified as poor or extremely poor. The event in Jiaxing is just one of many examples of how capitalist development leads to the degradation of resources for the sake of profit maximization. A desire for financial gains combined with agricultural production can lead to exporting pollution, in this case through the means of dead pigs, as well as dangerous products (i.e. the meat of the carcusses that had consumed arsenic being sold to market dwellers). Lastly, the expectation that increasing profits should be the ultimate goal of businesses, or the “profit imperative,” creates significant burdens for the environment and society. Social costs are all the direct and indirect losses suffered by the general public as a result of private economic activities; instead of the farmers losing money for the sake of properly disposing of their pathogenic pigs, they placed that cost onto society by contaminating the river water with arsenic and potential vectors for disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these key political and social factors have been contributing to the environmental degradation in China, it is also by social forces that the people can fight back and demand a cultural reversion to pre-industrial ideologies. Specifically, it is through the modernization of public art that society can reflect on China’s current capitalistic culture and call for the readoption of the “nature is dominant to man” mantra. How is this being done? Cai Guo Qiang is an artist based in China that is using the installation of provocative exhibitions to create a social commentary that allows for advocacy that fights for stronger environmental regulations to reduce instances like the Huangpu River. Cai’s exhibit specifically suggestions the theme that “nature’s state of helplessness in the face of modern man’s relentless” is due to the inextricable connection between nature and man that has been lost on the current production climate. His piece, Silent Ink, potrarys the harsh reality that many of China’s rivers have been so polluted by industrial waste, they are no longer sources of potable water. This painting not only draws attention to the environmental issues at hand but also subtly connects the traditional use of landscape painting, where nature dominated man, to evoke a core community feeling in viewers that can be tied back to their ancestors. Art that strides the line between what our social norms are and challenging if that’s what they ought to be sparks conversation within the viewer that the social norms might not be in the best interest of environmental health. As such, China’s profit imperative and position in the polluter-industrial economy of the world should be looked at under this sociological microscope that examines traditional and modern art forms as calls for action to develop a new economy that is built on environmental awareness, not on profitization. While it is clear that the social an political forces of the Industrial Revolution sparked China’s expansion into creating a profitable economy over promoting ecological harmony, the social forces of traditional artistic expression of community norms are finally starting to become strong enough, with the aid of modernized agendas, to fight for the right of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://rileygiallanza.github.io/candid/DSC_3167 (1).jpg&#34; width=80%&gt;
Over the past ten years, the world of photography has faced a complete reinvention. 
The explosion of digital media in this technological age has had foundational consequences for photography. From a change in the mediums used to showcase work all the way to its overall purpose, professional photographers and amateurs alike have felt the undeniable shift in the field of photography. 
&lt;p&gt;As of July 2020, Instagram has 1 billion monthly active users. In just 10 years, a single social media platform has 1/7th of the world using it. For those unfamiliar with the interface, Instagram’s main timeline is filled with posts from accounts you follow, an explore page has recommended posts the algorithm thinks you might like, and there are 24-hour long stories that allow for more personal and relatable posts to be shared between followers. The 22-year-old freelance photographer, who we’ll call Emma, says the “greatest thing about Instagram is that it’s [a] walking portfolio,” and she’s right! A portfolio is a curation of the best artwork that you use to show to potential clients, and considering Instagram has three key modes of engagement, it’s an asset to the photography community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does Instagram showcase your work in unique ways, but you can also post a new piece of work from anywhere, at any time, and it will digitally upload instantaneously. This is more convenient for photographers and it’s more cost-conscious. Before social media, to curate a portfolio, you would have to spend “hundreds of dollars on prints, hours choosing exactly which photos to showcase, and even more, time deciding the best arrangement for them” whether they are in book format or in a gallery, Emma explains. Instagram has single-handedly reinvented one of the most crucial aspects of gaining exposure and legitimacy as a photographer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rileygiallanza.github.io/candid/DSC_6321 (2).jpg&#34; width=80%&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connections one can make via social media are also a benefit that helps photographers reach more potential clientele. When talking to Charlie, an 18-year-old aspiring photographer from New Zealand, he spoke fondly of Instagram with respect to its outreach capabilities. He told me about the success of his friend, a professional photographer that now specializes in skiing shots. His friends didn’t necessarily get offered his current gig due to his expertise in the field, but “through those needed connections” he made by sharing his photography on Instagram. Charlie himself has made connections with a handful of photographers too, and while he’s not shooting with a “professional title,” the virtual network has helped him gain exposure and traction from other artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clear advantage of social media is the extent to which outreach is possible. However, there are downsides to the accessibility platforms like Instagram provide. The market has become oversaturated with photos. It’s incredibly easy to upload your photos through this digital platform, so it’s not only photographers who are posting their work; people that share blurry shots of their overpriced lunch, out of focus images of their dogs, and their almost-too-perfect beach vacations have flooded the space. According to Emma, the increased supply of photos has devalued professional photography services. Now that producing photos is accessible through digital formats, selling prints, or getting hired for a specific project is becoming more difficult because there’s added competition. So has accessibility to freelance photography actually increased, or has the reinvention of the field been so drastic that the capitalistic mantra behind the career is masked by the technological revolution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rileygiallanza.github.io/candid/DSC_3203 (1).jpg&#34; width=80%&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of photography has undoubtedly changed. What used to be considered a prestigious art form is now a leisurely activity to capture random, unimportant moments. The hoarding nature driven by capitalism has over popularized photography, which negatively affects the extent to which artistic expressions of history and the world around us are captured and viewed. Instagram posts are now associated with “popularity contests,” Emma says, which shifts the focus from posting photos that creatively challenge our followers to make them jealous of our view of the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photograph used to be a piece of art that was cherished. Few people had the talent to produce prints worthy of being sold, reprinted, and displayed in homes or offices, which meant owning a piece of work was a luxury. This gave the craft respect and was a career that was highly esteemed. Now, people who can print cheap copies of their overexposed shot of backyard plants call themselves photographers. This isn’t an argument to say people shouldn’t be printing their photos, this is an example of the idea that the title “photographer” doesn’t hold value in society anymore. The lack of prestige associated with being a photographer has made it “super hard to be in [the] the field” professionally, Charlie acknowledges. The increased printing abilities also don’t prove that accessibility has increased, snapshots for personal enjoyment are becoming more popular, but true expertise in the field of photography isn’t expanding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rileygiallanza.github.io/candid/DSC_0126.jpg&#34; width=80%&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has technological innovation benefitted photographers? This question is hard to answer for a professional and for an ameteur for a few reasons. First, the overproduction of photography equipment makes purchasing a new setup overwhelming and far more complicated than it needs to be. There are dozens of companies that produce multiple types of cameras, lenses, and other essential pieces of gear, so the process of determining which style will best suit your needs takes way too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has also become “prohibitively expensive” to get into photography, says Charlie. Trying to bridge the gap from being an ameteur to a professional photographer can cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars. Charlie’s piece of advice was to buy an older camera. There are “many point and shoots that are cheaper [than a DSLR]&amp;hellip; like $500 for a good, mirrorless sensor,” he says, but the main issue is “they’re not interchangeable,” meaning the camera only has one lens, making it not versatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age shouldn’t make you shy away from picking up a camera; older models not only have amazing shoot quality, but allow you to change the lens. This gives photographers the ability to specify the type of images they produce, because different types of lenses are better suited for different types of photography. Charlie, for example, had an old Olympian 12mm, a wide-angle lens that is best suited for landscape photography. Emma, on the other hand, owns a Nikkor 85mm which creates creamy backgrounds perfect for headshots. My own favorite lens is the Sigma 18-35mm, which is wide enough to shoot landscapes and cityscapes, but can also zoom in to the perfect focal length to shoot portraits. You can start to see now how not being able to switch which lens is on your camera can be a drawback to those pursuing a professional career, and why the versatility of older camera models is a greater asset than the rapid technological development of cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea that owning flashy new equipment is the gateway to becoming a professional photographer is what Emma views as a major pitfall in the industry. Gear “is the last barrier” to professionalism; the quality of an image has very little to do with what type of camera or setup was used, but rather the skills and artistic expression of the photo itself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Dramatic Response to Being Called Emotional - How The American Patriarchy Has Shaped Women’s Communication</title>
      <link>https://rileygiallanza.github.io/dramatizing-women/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://rileygiallanza.github.io/dramatizing-women/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Great American Experience is wrapped around watching grown men play a game of fetch (football). Alcoholic beverages and burgers are a must. Inappropriate behavior and irrational agitation too. The epitome of man in this country is yelling at a television screen full of dudes in tights, beer in hand, and whining like a child does when they’ve lost their blankie if someone doesn’t make a touchdown. “Hey honey, I’m sorry that I didn’t cry while watching that incredibly devastating movie about a man slowly losing his wife to untreatable cancer, but I did throw a fit when Tom Brady fumbled and cost us the game, so call me emotionally mature.” I have literally seen forty and fifty-year-old men break plates, chuck food, and start fistfights because of the outcome of a football game… and people call women emotional. Patriarchal views are so deeply rooted in American society, there is an intense double standard when comparing men’s and women’s emotional proficiency. Regardless of experience or ability, there is an underlying perception that women are less qualified and less competent than men. This gender bias epidemic has played a critical role in how women have adapted their communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was watching football with my parents and eating this glorious bacon and aged cheddar burger (not like you would have expected anything else). However, my throat started to itch a few minutes into eating. It wasn’t anaphylactic shock, trust me, I’m deathly allergic to peanuts and my family frequently poisons me with them, so I would have known if I needed to jab my leg with an EpiPen. Nevertheless, I continued to eat red meat for another month. One night, I was enjoying this really fancy, really expensive, piece of steak when all of a sudden I developed hives in my throat. It felt like there was a golf ball stuck in my esophagus, I couldn’t swallow and could barely breathe. Ten glasses, that’s correct, ten glasses of water and one Benadryl later, I could feel the reaction start to subside. When I finally told my parents what happened, they didn’t believe me. “Sweetie, you’re being dramatic. You’re not allergic to red meat, you ate it perfectly fine last week.” Gee thanks parentals, you’re right! The hives inside of my throat have magically disappeared, I’m cured! Parents often think their kids dramatize things, and they do, but this situation is entirely different. Why would I fake being allergic to something? This boiled down to the stigma that women exaggerate things. Society has gotten so used to the idea that women’s reactions are irrational, even proclamations of life-threatening situations aren’t registered as serious. In order to convince my parents I am actually allergic to red meat, I had to show them the Benadryl wrapper and the hives forming on my neck. Not taking my word for it and asking me to provide evidence sounds awfully similar to a practice that girls succumb to when reporting cases of sexual assault… weird. The exasperation and urgency in my words were not enough to convince my parents that I can’t eat red meat anymore. I surpassed the use of language to communicate. The fact that I can’t speak my truth and have people believe me, especially on serious subject matter like having a food allergy, is a pointless consequence the patriarchy has instilled in society&amp;rsquo;s mindset. Language is supposed to be universal, while obviously vast and differing between region and country, the majority of people communicate and express thought through language. However, women have to cater to the frail ego of America and adjust the way we express ourselves. Society holds this twisted, psychological superiority over us and our expression of emotions, in which we can’t rely only on words to share our experiences, we must perform for society before our encounters are registered at face value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the game. A fit of irrational anger ignites inside men when the team they like doesn’t win. They don’t even know the team personally, the outcome of the game has no real effect on their lives, yet they break items, make messes, and even verbally attack people around them due to this rage. If men feel this entitled to an emotional outburst due to football, do you see how these behaviors could be applied to a feeling of entitlement to women’s bodies? Catcalling is so prevalent in America I would argue that it’s normalized in society now. I blame it on language being a masculine discourse, that’s to say, the rules and norms of language use in America are determined by men. This seems to give men justification to talk to us like we’re objects at their disposal and our only purpose in life is to serve their desires. Predators remove our identity by taking away our ability to use language. They invalidate us usually with a single word or phrase. Catcallers will comment on our physical appearances, our body types, they’ll tell us to take our clothes off, or sexualize any aspect of our beings, during a brief and random encounter. Men feel so superior to women, that within seconds of seeing us, they use language to assert their dominance and “ownership.” And in those crucial, fleeting seconds, men suppress our freedom of speech. We are now put in a dangerous situation of balancing if we should talk and what we should say. Do you stay silent and not make eye contact, do you smile and wave, do you say “thank you” and keep walking, or do you bark at them until they think you’re too crazy to get involved with? We have to carefully calculate how we’re going to respond because if we choose the wrong approach, we could risk our safety. In “How to Tame a Wild Tongue,” Gloria Anzaldúa reflects on being Chicano and her use of her native dialect, describing how she was discriminated against by other cultures that had a sense of superiority associated with their language. The consequences were “repeated attacks [to] diminish [her] sense of self,” and this ties into the frequent infringements on women’s security and violation of our identity by men dictating language use (Anzaldúa 80). This silence, suppressing our own thoughts and our right to speak, is devaluing us as humans. We have to conform to a version of ourselves that we’re not, we can’t speak our minds or be true to our values when we get catcalled. We have to repress any sense of self-identity in order to stay safe from these men who think they have a right to us. But this is not just a fight for social dominance, the patriarchy’s impact on women’s communication skills has become a political and institutional issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every aspect of my life is determined by my willingness to follow men’s orders. Be polite&amp;ndash;don’t raise your voice, don’t speak out of turn, use respectful phrasing and tones. Be feminine&amp;ndash;don’t use big words, speak slow, don’t have too much confidence in your voice. These rules we have to follow just to converse with others are meaningless; women have the same right to speak as men, it&amp;rsquo;s written in the constitution, yet we’re still held to these standards by society. At work, if we don’t respectfully address our audience, we’re deemed rude. And if we interrupt someone, even if they cut us off first, we’re disrespectful. Don’t even get me started on the idea that speaking at a higher volume or speaking with confidence actually marks us as too emotional and hard to work with. How can we overcome this? Well, women can start to accept this silence as a form of resistance. Rachel Cusk described in “Coventry,” we have the capability to decide if others can break us down. Her parents sent her to this illusionary place in order to make her feel inferior, but later in life, she was able to overcome the negative association of being sent to Coventry, and found that being there, in silence, gave her authority. We must fight this “attempt [of the patriarchy] to recover power,” and let the suppression of language guide our ability to communicate using our facial expressions, body language, or anything that can aid in sharing our thoughts and feelings effectively (Cusk 2). For instance, instead of being aggravated that my parents didn’t take my word for being allergic to red meat, I should feel accomplished that I was able to prove them wrong by using other communication skills. Regardless of them not believing me at first, perseverance in communicating led them to hear me and take what I said as the clear truth. Taking away our security in communication isn’t fair, but neither is letting this obstruction ruin the premise of conversation with others; we ought not to let the lack of freedom to use language deteriorate our communication skills. Cusk alluded to the idea that we’re meant to feel inferior for a reason, so now we need to resist this idea that women are too emotional to be independently successful in life. We are rational thinkers, we use objective evidence to guide our decisions, we’re skillful at finding warrants for our claims, and we don’t act on a sudden thought. Men, on the other hand, cry when football games don’t work out the way they want. Perhaps the gender bias epidemic that’s riddled in American culture will never subside, but women are going to take back their power and reclaim their adapted communication skills as an asset, rather than as a means to appease the patriarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
