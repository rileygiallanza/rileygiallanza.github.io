[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Hi there! I am a second year undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying Health Science in the Bouvé College of Health Sciences. My education interests lie in the realm of public health. I\u0026#39;m incredibly passionate about advocacy for public health, specifically for environmental health justice. Currently, I am writing a literature review as a \u0026#34;Health Equity Research Intern\u0026#34; about using public art as a mechanism for educating the public on the threats climate change poses to health. My other research interests include epidemiology and biostatistics. I am also proficient in the coding language R! My professional goals align with pursing graduate school to obtain an MPH and then a PhD in environmental health. Aside from academics, I run my own photography business - Riley G Photography - where I work with clients for portraiture and sell prints of landscapes/cityscapes!\n  Download my resumé.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://rileygiallanza.github.io/author/riley-giallanza/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/riley-giallanza/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi there!
