By this, the cultural competence that traditional art forms, such as landscape paintings, facilitated in China focused on the idea that man was not powerful enough to dominate the natural world and exploit its resources. Rather, nature and man established a society in which the natural world dominated humans. Only after the Industrial Revolution did the dynamism associated with production and profit lead to man over nature becoming the prevalent social contract. Unfortunately, the cultural standard for the natural world was not strong enough in the nineteenth century to oppose the endorsement of an industrialized, man-focused economy. The adopted framework of businesses in post-industrial China includes that anthropogenic activities, such as pollution, can be externalized on society for the purpose of maximizing economic progress, which has led to intense environmental damage. The current political and social movements in China are at a crossroads – politics governed by economically-motivated lobbyists has allowed incidences, like in Huangpu River, to play out, while the social hubbub of public art is leading to individual and community empowerment models that are fighting for change within our systems to create a more environmentally friendly world. In this paper, the focus will shift from the social and political forces that are the reason for environmental degradation, to instead arguing that the adoption and modernization of art forms will empower society to fight for change for the sake of the environment and fix the issues that stemmed from the cultural adoption of humans being above all else.\nIn March 2013, over 16000 pig carcusses were pulled out of the Huangpu River in Shanghai in the span of two weeks. The destination of origin, Jiaxing, a large pig-farming province that’s upstream of the city, was responsible for providing 7.78 million pigs to the Chinese market in 2012 alone. Although the Shanghai Municipal Water Authority deemed the water to meet the standard for safe consumption, there were many environmental and health implications the residents located along the river had to deal with. The pigs tested positive for porcine circovirus (PVC), foot and mouth disease, swine fever, hog cholera, and blue-ear pig disease. Alone, these diseases are not known to be infectious to humans, but the means by which the pigs had these diseases is what was concerning. Because pork is the most widely consumed meat in China, the density of pig farmers is very high. In Jiaxing specifically, the pig farms were “small-scale enterprises”, but there was a large accumulation of them in the area (Ejatlas). These farms were also very poorly kept, therefore they were discharging pollutants in amounts exceeding the carrying capacity of the environment, which led to the facilitation of these swine-based pathogens and the ultimate death of numerous pigs.\nWith a need to rid large amounts of carcasses, and weak regulations in place, instead of properly disposing of the dead pigs, many farmers began selling these pathogenic carcasses to slaughterhouses. This resulted in the meat being sold in markets for illegal profits. Once the health concerns began to make their way to public knowledge, the illegal trade of contaminated pork was cracked down on. This is when farmers began disposing of the carcasses in the water supply because it was more convenient. However, before the farmers were caught in their illegal trading scheme, they grew accustomed to using a feed additive in the pig’s diet that was a form of organic arsenic . The chemical components help make the pigs look more aesthetically healthy and viable to consumers from the markets. Arsenic, however, is identified as a human carcinogen, as noted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Therefore, when the contaminated pigs were sold in markets people would directly consume small levels of arsenic. When the pigs were dumped in the Huangpu River, the arsenic levels were small enough to not be detected by the municipality, so when it was deemed potable, consumers of the river would indirectly be ingesting arsenic. The clear environmental impacts were water pollution, livestock damage, and insecurity of drinking water quality, and the health impacts were unknown exposure to infectious diseases and carcinogens.\nThe political and social forces at play that interrupted China’s cultural appreciation of the environment led to this instance and others alike in their capacity for environmental degradation. First, climate change is largely anthropogenic. The consumption and production levels by humans are by far the largest contributor to the release of greenhouse gases. Human activities, like pollution and habitat fragmentation, can produce numerous stressors on aquatic ecosystems; chemical pollution by agricultural and …","date":1635120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635120000,"objectID":"0a847e5c7f73184c7d4a97c7c6b61da9","permalink":"https://rileygiallanza.github.io/public-art/","publishdate":"2021-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/public-art/","section":"","summary":"footnote example 1\nThe expansive history of pre-industrial China had its social norms rooted in people’s appreciation for the world in which they lived.

The explosion of digital media in this technological age has had foundational consequences for photography. From a change in the mediums used to showcase work all the way to its overall purpose, professional photographers and amateurs alike have felt the undeniable shift in the field of photography. As of July 2020, Instagram has 1 billion monthly active users. In just 10 years, a single social media platform has 1/7th of the world using it. For those unfamiliar with the interface, Instagram’s main timeline is filled with posts from accounts you follow, an explore page has recommended posts the algorithm thinks you might like, and there are 24-hour long stories that allow for more personal and relatable posts to be shared between followers. The 22-year-old freelance photographer, who we’ll call Emma, says the “greatest thing about Instagram is that it’s [a] walking portfolio,” and she’s right! A portfolio is a curation of the best artwork that you use to show to potential clients, and considering Instagram has three key modes of engagement, it’s an asset to the photography community.\nNot only does Instagram showcase your work in unique ways, but you can also post a new piece of work from anywhere, at any time, and it will digitally upload instantaneously. This is more convenient for photographers and it’s more cost-conscious. Before social media, to curate a portfolio, you would have to spend “hundreds of dollars on prints, hours choosing exactly which photos to showcase, and even more, time deciding the best arrangement for them” whether they are in book format or in a gallery, Emma explains. Instagram has single-handedly reinvented one of the most crucial aspects of gaining exposure and legitimacy as a photographer.\nThe connections one can make via social media are also a benefit that helps photographers reach more potential clientele. When talking to Charlie, an 18-year-old aspiring photographer from New Zealand, he spoke fondly of Instagram with respect to its outreach capabilities. He told me about the success of his friend, a professional photographer that now specializes in skiing shots. His friends didn’t necessarily get offered his current gig due to his expertise in the field, but “through those needed connections” he made by sharing his photography on Instagram. Charlie himself has made connections with a handful of photographers too, and while he’s not shooting with a “professional title,” the virtual network has helped him gain exposure and traction from other artists.\nThe clear advantage of social media is the extent to which outreach is possible. However, there are downsides to the accessibility platforms like Instagram provide. The market has become oversaturated with photos. It’s incredibly easy to upload your photos through this digital platform, so it’s not only photographers who are posting their work; people that share blurry shots of their overpriced lunch, out of focus images of their dogs, and their almost-too-perfect beach vacations have flooded the space. According to Emma, the increased supply of photos has devalued professional photography services. Now that producing photos is accessible through digital formats, selling prints, or getting hired for a specific project is becoming more difficult because there’s added competition. So has accessibility to freelance photography actually increased, or has the reinvention of the field been so drastic that the capitalistic mantra behind the career is masked by the technological revolution?\nThe purpose of photography has undoubtedly changed. What used to be considered a prestigious art form is now a leisurely activity to capture random, unimportant moments. The hoarding nature driven by capitalism has over popularized photography, which negatively affects the extent to which artistic expressions of history and the world around us are captured and viewed. Instagram posts are now associated with “popularity contests,” Emma says, which shifts the focus from posting photos that creatively challenge our followers to make them jealous of our view of the sunset.\nA photograph used to be a piece of art that was cherished. Few people had the talent to produce prints worthy of being sold, reprinted, and displayed in homes or offices, which meant owning a piece of work was a luxury. This gave the craft respect and was a career that was highly esteemed. Now, people who can print cheap copies of their overexposed shot of backyard plants call themselves photographers. This isn’t an argument to say people shouldn’t be printing their photos, this is an example of the idea that the title “photographer” doesn’t hold value in society anymore. The lack of prestige associated with being a photographer has made it “super hard to be in [the] the field” professionally, Charlie acknowledges. The increased printing abilities also don’t prove that accessibility has increased, …","date":1601683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601683200,"objectID":"3df1b01d1570ce31aa2c5b9f8003b1e1","permalink":"https://rileygiallanza.github.io/candid/","publishdate":"2020-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/candid/","section":"","summary":"Over the past ten years, the world of photography has faced a complete reinvention.

Alcoholic beverages and burgers are a must. Inappropriate behavior and irrational agitation too. The epitome of man in this country is yelling at a television screen full of dudes in tights, beer in hand, and whining like a child does when they’ve lost their blankie if someone doesn’t make a touchdown. “Hey honey, I’m sorry that I didn’t cry while watching that incredibly devastating movie about a man slowly losing his wife to untreatable cancer, but I did throw a fit when Tom Brady fumbled and cost us the game, so call me emotionally mature.” I have literally seen forty and fifty-year-old men break plates, chuck food, and start fistfights because of the outcome of a football game… and people call women emotional. Patriarchal views are so deeply rooted in American society, there is an intense double standard when comparing men’s and women’s emotional proficiency. Regardless of experience or ability, there is an underlying perception that women are less qualified and less competent than men. This gender bias epidemic has played a critical role in how women have adapted their communication skills.\nTwo years ago, I was watching football with my parents and eating this glorious bacon and aged cheddar burger (not like you would have expected anything else). However, my throat started to itch a few minutes into eating. It wasn’t anaphylactic shock, trust me, I’m deathly allergic to peanuts and my family frequently poisons me with them, so I would have known if I needed to jab my leg with an EpiPen. Nevertheless, I continued to eat red meat for another month. One night, I was enjoying this really fancy, really expensive, piece of steak when all of a sudden I developed hives in my throat. It felt like there was a golf ball stuck in my esophagus, I couldn’t swallow and could barely breathe. Ten glasses, that’s correct, ten glasses of water and one Benadryl later, I could feel the reaction start to subside. When I finally told my parents what happened, they didn’t believe me. “Sweetie, you’re being dramatic. You’re not allergic to red meat, you ate it perfectly fine last week.” Gee thanks parentals, you’re right! The hives inside of my throat have magically disappeared, I’m cured! Parents often think their kids dramatize things, and they do, but this situation is entirely different. Why would I fake being allergic to something? This boiled down to the stigma that women exaggerate things. Society has gotten so used to the idea that women’s reactions are irrational, even proclamations of life-threatening situations aren’t registered as serious. In order to convince my parents I am actually allergic to red meat, I had to show them the Benadryl wrapper and the hives forming on my neck. Not taking my word for it and asking me to provide evidence sounds awfully similar to a practice that girls succumb to when reporting cases of sexual assault… weird. The exasperation and urgency in my words were not enough to convince my parents that I can’t eat red meat anymore. I surpassed the use of language to communicate. The fact that I can’t speak my truth and have people believe me, especially on serious subject matter like having a food allergy, is a pointless consequence the patriarchy has instilled in society’s mindset. Language is supposed to be universal, while obviously vast and differing between region and country, the majority of people communicate and express thought through language. However, women have to cater to the frail ego of America and adjust the way we express ourselves. Society holds this twisted, psychological superiority over us and our expression of emotions, in which we can’t rely only on words to share our experiences, we must perform for society before our encounters are registered at face value.\nLet’s go back to the game. A fit of irrational anger ignites inside men when the team they like doesn’t win. They don’t even know the team personally, the outcome of the game has no real effect on their lives, yet they break items, make messes, and even verbally attack people around them due to this rage. If men feel this entitled to an emotional outburst due to football, do you see how these behaviors could be applied to a feeling of entitlement to women’s bodies? Catcalling is so prevalent in America I would argue that it’s normalized in society now. I blame it on language being a masculine discourse, that’s to say, the rules and norms of language use in America are determined by men. This seems to give men justification to talk to us like we’re objects at their disposal and our only purpose in life is to serve their desires. Predators remove our identity by taking away our ability to use language. They invalidate us usually with a single word or phrase. Catcallers will comment on our physical appearances, our body types, they’ll tell us to take our clothes off, or sexualize any aspect of our beings, during a …","date":1601424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601424000,"objectID":"85066bddb96ab933efa570130238c71e","permalink":"https://rileygiallanza.github.io/dramatizing-women/","publishdate":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/dramatizing-women/","section":"","summary":"The Great American Experience is wrapped around watching grown men play a game of fetch (football).

perception is the top-down process in which our brain creates meaning by organising and interpreting what our sense detecthow do absolute thresholds and difference thresholds differ and what effect, if any, do stimuli below the absolute threshold have on us?what are absolute thresholds?the minimum stimulation necessary to detect a particular light, sound, pressure, taste, or odor 50 percent of the timewhat is signal detection theory?a prediction of when we will detect weak signalswhat are subliminal stimuli?signals you can\u0026#39;t detect 50 percent of the time; they are below your absolute thresholdwhat is priming?the activation of certain associations, thus predisposing one\u0026#39;s perception, memory, or responsewhat are difference thresholds?the minimum difference a person can detect between any two stimuli half the time; this increases with the size of the stimuluswhat is weber\u0026#39;s law?for an average person to perceive a difference, two stimuli must differ by a constant minimum percentageusing sound as your example, explain how these concepts differ: absolute threshold, subliminal stimulation, and difference threshold?absolute threshold is the minimum stimulation needed to detect a particular sound 50 percent of the time. subliminal stimulation happens when our sensory system processes the sound of the approaching object. a difference threshold is the minimum difference needed to distinguish between two soundswhat is the function of sensory adaptation?what is sensory adaptation?diminished sensitivity as a consequence of constant stimulationwhat is an important benefit of sensory adaptation?is gives us the freedom to focus on informative changes in our environment without being distracted by background chatter;
