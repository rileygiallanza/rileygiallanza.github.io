By this, the cultural competence that traditional art forms, such as landscape paintings, facilitated in China focused on the idea that man was not powerful enough to dominate the natural world and exploit its resources. Rather, nature and man established a society in which the natural world dominated humans. Only after the Industrial Revolution did the dynamism associated with production and profit lead to man over nature becoming the prevalent social contract. Unfortunately, the cultural standard for the natural world was not strong enough in the nineteenth century to oppose the endorsement of an industrialized, man-focused economy. The adopted framework of businesses in post-industrial China includes that anthropogenic activities, such as pollution, can be externalized on society for the purpose of maximizing economic progress, which has led to intense environmental damage. The current political and social movements in China are at a crossroads – politics governed by economically-motivated lobbyists has allowed incidences, like in Huangpu River, to play out, while the social hubbub of public art is leading to individual and community empowerment models that are fighting for change within our systems to create a more environmentally friendly world. In this paper, the focus will shift from the social and political forces that are the reason for environmental degradation, to instead arguing that the adoption and modernization of art forms will empower society to fight for change for the sake of the environment and fix the issues that stemmed from the cultural adoption of humans being above all else.\nIn March 2013, over 16000 pig carcusses were pulled out of the Huangpu River in Shanghai in the span of two weeks. The destination of origin, Jiaxing, a large pig-farming province that’s upstream of the city, was responsible for providing 7.78 million pigs to the Chinese market in 2012 alone. Although the Shanghai Municipal Water Authority deemed the water to meet the standard for safe consumption, there were many environmental and health implications the residents located along the river had to deal with. The pigs tested positive for porcine circovirus (PVC), foot and mouth disease, swine fever, hog cholera, and blue-ear pig disease. Alone, these diseases are not known to be infectious to humans, but the means by which the pigs had these diseases is what was concerning. Because pork is the most widely consumed meat in China, the density of pig farmers is very high. In Jiaxing specifically, the pig farms were “small-scale enterprises”, but there was a large accumulation of them in the area (Ejatlas). These farms were also very poorly kept, therefore they were discharging pollutants in amounts exceeding the carrying capacity of the environment, which led to the facilitation of these swine-based pathogens and the ultimate death of numerous pigs.\nWith a need to rid large amounts of carcasses, and weak regulations in place, instead of properly disposing of the dead pigs, many farmers began selling these pathogenic carcasses to slaughterhouses. This resulted in the meat being sold in markets for illegal profits. Once the health concerns began to make their way to public knowledge, the illegal trade of contaminated pork was cracked down on. This is when farmers began disposing of the carcasses in the water supply because it was more convenient. However, before the farmers were caught in their illegal trading scheme, they grew accustomed to using a feed additive in the pig’s diet that was a form of organic arsenic . The chemical components help make the pigs look more aesthetically healthy and viable to consumers from the markets. Arsenic, however, is identified as a human carcinogen, as noted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Therefore, when the contaminated pigs were sold in markets people would directly consume small levels of arsenic. When the pigs were dumped in the Huangpu River, the arsenic levels were small enough to not be detected by the municipality, so when it was deemed potable, consumers of the river would indirectly be ingesting arsenic. The clear environmental impacts were water pollution, livestock damage, and insecurity of drinking water quality, and the health impacts were unknown exposure to infectious diseases and carcinogens.\nThe political and social forces at play that interrupted China’s cultural appreciation of the environment led to this instance and others alike in their capacity for environmental degradation. First, climate change is largely anthropogenic. The consumption and production levels by humans are by far the largest contributor to the release of greenhouse gases. Human activities, like pollution and habitat fragmentation, can produce numerous stressors on aquatic ecosystems; chemical pollution by agricultural and livestock waste …","date":1635120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635120000,"objectID":"3aa4af141385e13467920922863ebac3","permalink":"https://rileygiallanza.github.io/articles/public-art/","publishdate":"2021-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/articles/public-art/","section":"Articles","summary":"The expansive history of pre-industrial China had its social norms rooted in people’s appreciation for the world in which they lived.
