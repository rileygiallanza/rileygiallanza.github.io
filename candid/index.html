Over the past ten years, the world of photography has faced a complete reinvention. 
The explosion of digital media in this technological age has had foundational consequences for photography. From a change in the mediums used to showcase work all the way to its overall purpose, professional photographers and amateurs alike have felt the undeniable shift in the field of photography. 
<p>As of July 2020, Instagram has 1 billion monthly active users. In just 10 years, a single social media platform has 1/7th of the world using it. For those unfamiliar with the interface, Instagram’s main timeline is filled with posts from accounts you follow, an explore page has recommended posts the algorithm thinks you might like, and there are 24-hour long stories that allow for more personal and relatable posts to be shared between followers. The 22-year-old freelance photographer, who we’ll call Emma, says the “greatest thing about Instagram is that it’s [a] walking portfolio,” and she’s right! A portfolio is a curation of the best artwork that you use to show to potential clients, and considering Instagram has three key modes of engagement, it’s an asset to the photography community.</p>
<p>Not only does Instagram showcase your work in unique ways, but you can also post a new piece of work from anywhere, at any time, and it will digitally upload instantaneously. This is more convenient for photographers and it’s more cost-conscious. Before social media, to curate a portfolio, you would have to spend “hundreds of dollars on prints, hours choosing exactly which photos to showcase, and even more, time deciding the best arrangement for them” whether they are in book format or in a gallery, Emma explains. Instagram has single-handedly reinvented one of the most crucial aspects of gaining exposure and legitimacy as a photographer.</p>
<img src="/candid/DSC_6321 (2).jpg" width=80%>
<p>The connections one can make via social media are also a benefit that helps photographers reach more potential clientele. When talking to Charlie, an 18-year-old aspiring photographer from New Zealand, he spoke fondly of Instagram with respect to its outreach capabilities. He told me about the success of his friend, a professional photographer that now specializes in skiing shots. His friends didn’t necessarily get offered his current gig due to his expertise in the field, but “through those needed connections” he made by sharing his photography on Instagram. Charlie himself has made connections with a handful of photographers too, and while he’s not shooting with a “professional title,” the virtual network has helped him gain exposure and traction from other artists.</p>
<p>The clear advantage of social media is the extent to which outreach is possible. However, there are downsides to the accessibility platforms like Instagram provide. The market has become oversaturated with photos. It’s incredibly easy to upload your photos through this digital platform, so it’s not only photographers who are posting their work; people that share blurry shots of their overpriced lunch, out of focus images of their dogs, and their almost-too-perfect beach vacations have flooded the space. According to Emma, the increased supply of photos has devalued professional photography services. Now that producing photos is accessible through digital formats, selling prints, or getting hired for a specific project is becoming more difficult because there’s added competition. So has accessibility to freelance photography actually increased, or has the reinvention of the field been so drastic that the capitalistic mantra behind the career is masked by the technological revolution?</p>
<img src="/candid/DSC_3203 (1).jpg" width=80%>
<p>The purpose of photography has undoubtedly changed. What used to be considered a prestigious art form is now a leisurely activity to capture random, unimportant moments. The hoarding nature driven by capitalism has over popularized photography, which negatively affects the extent to which artistic expressions of history and the world around us are captured and viewed. Instagram posts are now associated with “popularity contests,” Emma says, which shifts the focus from posting photos that creatively challenge our followers to make them jealous of our view of the sunset.</p>
<p>A photograph used to be a piece of art that was cherished. Few people had the talent to produce prints worthy of being sold, reprinted, and displayed in homes or offices, which meant owning a piece of work was a luxury. This gave the craft respect and was a career that was highly esteemed. Now, people who can print cheap copies of their overexposed shot of backyard plants call themselves photographers. This isn’t an argument to say people shouldn’t be printing their photos, this is an example of the idea that the title “photographer” doesn’t hold value in society anymore. The lack of prestige associated with being a photographer has made it “super hard to be in [the] the field” professionally, Charlie acknowledges. The increased printing abilities also don’t prove that accessibility has increased, snapshots for personal enjoyment are becoming more popular, but true expertise in the field of photography isn’t expanding</p>
<img src="/candid/DSC_0126.jpg" width=80%>
<p>Has technological innovation benefitted photographers? This question is hard to answer for a professional and for an ameteur for a few reasons. First, the overproduction of photography equipment makes purchasing a new setup overwhelming and far more complicated than it needs to be. There are dozens of companies that produce multiple types of cameras, lenses, and other essential pieces of gear, so the process of determining which style will best suit your needs takes way too long.</p>
<p>It has also become “prohibitively expensive” to get into photography, says Charlie. Trying to bridge the gap from being an ameteur to a professional photographer can cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars. Charlie’s piece of advice was to buy an older camera. There are “many point and shoots that are cheaper [than a DSLR]&hellip; like $500 for a good, mirrorless sensor,” he says, but the main issue is “they’re not interchangeable,” meaning the camera only has one lens, making it not versatile.</p>
<p>Age shouldn’t make you shy away from picking up a camera; older models not only have amazing shoot quality, but allow you to change the lens. This gives photographers the ability to specify the type of images they produce, because different types of lenses are better suited for different types of photography. Charlie, for example, had an old Olympian 12mm, a wide-angle lens that is best suited for landscape photography. Emma, on the other hand, owns a Nikkor 85mm which creates creamy backgrounds perfect for headshots. My own favorite lens is the Sigma 18-35mm, which is wide enough to shoot landscapes and cityscapes, but can also zoom in to the perfect focal length to shoot portraits. You can start to see now how not being able to switch which lens is on your camera can be a drawback to those pursuing a professional career, and why the versatility of older camera models is a greater asset than the rapid technological development of cameras.</p>
<p>This idea that owning flashy new equipment is the gateway to becoming a professional photographer is what Emma views as a major pitfall in the industry. Gear “is the last barrier” to professionalism; the quality of an image has very little to do with what type of camera or setup was used, but rather the skills and artistic expression of the photo itself.</p>
